# Observable Docs Test

## Hello Framework - In docs folder

In this example, the "dist" folder was renamed to "docs" so Github Pages could be pointed into it.

This allows the static files to reside at the URL root of the repo.

To implement, source files would need to reside in a folder other than the "docs" folder.

Test result: Formating broken. Supporting files may be needed external to the static files.
