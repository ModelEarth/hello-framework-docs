## Hello Framework - dist in docs folder

In this test, the "dist" folder was renamed to "docs" so Github Pages could be pointed into it.

Test result: Formating broken. Supporting files may be needed external to the static files.  
[model.earth/hello-framework-docs](https://model.earth/hello-framework-docs)

If we figure this out, the copied static files can reside at the URL root of the repo.

To implement, source files would need to reside in a folder other than the "docs" folder.
